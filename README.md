# Cplusplus-Program

# Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
The C++ Program is a final project submission for CS210, or project 3, aiming to analyze a list of produce items from a .txt file. It calculates and presents the frequency of each unique item, provides options to visualize frequencies through histograms, and allows users to create backups of the analyzed data.

# What did you do particularly well?
The implementation of the Produce class showcases strong use of object-oriented principles. The menu-driven user interface enhances user interactions, and the code efficiently handles input file processing and data analysis.

# Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, etc.?
Error handling could be improved by providing clearer error messages. Implementing memory management techniques like smart pointers would enhance memory allocation and deallocation. More user-friendly messages and input validation would improve the overall user experience.

# Did you find writing any piece of this code challenging and how did you overcome this? What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
Designing the code to handle file processing, user interactions, and data analysis was challenging. Breaking down tasks into smaller functions and consulting C++ documentation and online programming communities were valuable resources for overcoming challenges.

# What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or coursework?
Object-Oriented Programming: Implementing classes for organized data and behavior.
File Handling: Reading/writing data from/to files, a common programming task.
User Interface Design: Crafting user-friendly menus and interactions.
Algorithm Design: Creating algorithms for frequency calculations and data visualization.
